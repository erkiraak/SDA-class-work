# Airplane
In this project, you will model the passengers of an airplane.

-------------------------------------------------------
The group is to be divided to 2 subgroups. Some tasks are to be done individually, while the rests are to be divided between the subgroups.

The following table shows how the tasks are to be divided:

|Task       |Assignment           |
|-----------|---------------------|
|[Task 0](TASK_0.md) | Individually |
|[Task 1](TASK_1.md) | Subgroup 1 |
|[Task_2](TASK_2.md) | Subgroup 2 |
|[Task_3](TASK_3.md) | Subgroup 1 |
|[Task_4](TASK_4.md) | Subgroup 2 |

It is very advisable to check the other group tasks at least discuss their answers.

-------------------------------------------

When all tasks are done, you can run the file `src/main.py` and check the results. You should get an output similar to this one:
