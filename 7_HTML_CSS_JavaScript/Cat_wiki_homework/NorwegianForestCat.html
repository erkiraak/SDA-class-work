<p>
    The <b>Norwegian Forest cat</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language">Norwegian</a>: <b>Norsk
    skogskatt</b> and <b>Norsk skogskatt</b>) is a breed of domestic cat originating in Northern Europe.[1] This natural
    breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with a top coat of long, glossy, water-shedding hair and a woolly undercoat
    for insulation. The breed's ancestors may have been a landrace of short-haired cats brought to Norway about A.D.
    1000 by the Vikings, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern
    Siberian and Turkish Angora. During World War II, the Norwegian Forest cat was nearly extinct; then the Norwegian
    Forest Cat Club's breeding program increased the cat's number. It was registered as a breed with the European
    Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed
    and made efforts to register it. The breed is very popular in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and France.
    <br>
    It is a big, strong cat, similar to the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail, and a sturdy body. It is
    very good at climbing, partly because of strong claws. The lifespan is usually 14 to 16 years. Kidney and heart
    diseases have been reported in the breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching
    enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in
    glycogen storage disease type IV.[citation needed]
