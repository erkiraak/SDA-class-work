    Maine Coon

<p>
    The <b>Maine Coon</b> is a large domesticated cat breed. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America.
    The breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine,[3] where it is the official state cat.
    <br>
    The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired
    breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and is now
    the third most popular pedigreed cat breed in the world.[4]
    <br>
    The Maine Coon is a large and social cat, which could be the reason why the Maine Coon has a reputation of being
    referred to as, "the gentle giant." The Maine Coon is predominately known for its size and dense coat of fur which
    helps the large feline to survive in the harsh climate of Maine, the state from which they originated. Relaxed and
    laid-back, Maine Coons are not overly dependent, but they are people-oriented. The Maine Coon is often cited as
    having "dog-like" characteristics.[5][6]
