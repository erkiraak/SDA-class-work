    Exotic Shorthair
</h1>


<p>
    The <b> Exotic Shorthair </b> is a breed of cat developed as a short-haired version of the Persian. The Exotic is
    similar to the Persian in many ways, including temperament and conformation, a flat nose and face with the
    exceptions of the short dense coat.[1]
    <br>
    In the late 1950s, the Persian was used as an outcross by some American Shorthair breeders. This was done in secret
    in order to improve their body type, and crosses were also made with the Russian Blue and the Burmese. The
    crossbreed look gained recognition in the show ring, but unhappy American Shorthair breeders successfully produced a
    new breed standard that would disqualify American Shorthairs that showed signs of crossbreeding. One American
    Shorthair breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/American Shorthair cross proposed and eventually got the Cat
    Fanciers' Association judge and American Shorthair breeder Jane Martinke to recognize them as a new breed in 1966,
    under the name Exotic Shorthair. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers' Association closed the Exotic to shorthair outcrosses,
    leaving Persian as the only allowable outcross breed.
    <br>
    Because of the regular use of Persian as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene.
    When two such cats mate, there is a 1 in 4 chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not
    considered Persians by the Cat Fanciers' Association, although The International Cat Association accepts them as
    Persians. Other associations like the American Cat Fanciers Association register them as a separate Exotic Longhair
    breed.[2]
