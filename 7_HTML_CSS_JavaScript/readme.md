HTML - Hyper Text **Markup Language**

Markup - refers to data included in an electronic document which is distinct from the document's content in that it is
typically not included in representations of the document for end users, for example on paper or a computer screen, or
in an audio stream.[1] Markup is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its content to
facilitate automated processing. A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included
in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer
programs
